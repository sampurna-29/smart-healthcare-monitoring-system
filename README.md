#Smart Healthcare Monitoring  System 
##VAIDYARU HEALTH+

### Introduction:
VAIDYARU HEALTH+ is the ALL-IN-ONE smart healthcare system, developed with an aim to provide ease of convinience monitoring of vital functions of
a human body such as ECG Electrocardiogram, SPO2 levels, Temperature and Heartbeat The system very efficiently enables an individual to know about their health,
at any time of need and provides the essentials that they require at once. Further it analyses a body's current health parameters and displays them alongside 
recording and uploading the data to server, constant monitoring of data helps in indicating early anomalies and caution the patient of situations such as
Cardiac Arrest or Paralysis. It is a compact and convinient device and can used by people from age all groups very efficiently.
It has Following Features:   
1-HeartBeat Detection
2-SPO2 Level detection
3-Body temperature Detection
4-Air Quality Index Detection 
5-Room Temperature Detection
6-ECG Detection

## Hardware used:
1. Arduino Nano
2. MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter Sensor
3. LCD Display(16*2) with I2C module
4. AD8232 ECG Sensor
5. DS18B20 Bodytemperature Sensor
6. LM35 Temperature Sensor
7. MQ135 Air Quality Sensor
8-ESP8266 Wifi Module
9-Power supply components( TP4056 Charging Module,two 3.7 v Cell,7805 Voltage Regulator Circuit)


## Working: 
### Mannual-
   Works like any normal water tap used for irrigation.
### Automatic-
   The device comes with set of hours in which the plant is needed to be irrigated.It can be customized or can be fixed by the programmer like 4  times a day.
   If we choose automatic mode first our controller will fetch the time from RTC and check it with the irrigation time provided.If the time matches the controller will check for the    water level in the tank.If the water level is low it will indicate on the display otherwise if water level is fine it will check for the moisture content of soil.If the soil is      moist i.e plants are already irrigated and doesn't need any further water the pump will be in Off State.Whereas If the soil is Dry it will Turn ON the Pump  and water will start     flowing through the Pipe and once the moisture sensor senses the soil to be moist it will automatacilly turn the Pump Off till the next irrgation time and same process will be       proceed..
